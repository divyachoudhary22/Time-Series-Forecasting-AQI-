# Time-Series-Forecasting-AirQualityIndex-

- End-to-End Time Series Forecasting: 
  Developed a complete machine learning project to forecast Benzene air concentration using a real-world sensor dataset. The project       covered all stages from data cleaning and feature engineering to model training and evaluation.

- Advanced Data Preprocessing: 
  Engineered a robust data preprocessing pipeline to handle messy, real-world time series data. This included managing non-standard        missing values (-200), performing time-based data imputation using linear interpolation, and creating a unified DateTime index for       analysis.

- XGBoost Modeling and Feature Engineering: 
  Implemented a powerful XGBoost regression model for a complex forecasting task. Enhanced model performance by engineering key temporal   features (e.g., hour, day of week, month) to capture cyclical patterns in the data, achieving a final Mean Absolute Error of 0.05µg/m³.

- Model Evaluation and Interpretation: 
  Conducted a thorough model evaluation using RMSE and MAE metrics to validate predictive accuracy. Analyzed feature importance to         identify the most influential factors in predicting air quality, demonstrating an ability to interpret and explain model behavior.
